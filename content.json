It’s a time to reflect on the past year and set our sights on the year ahead. For many, Chinese New Year is the most important holiday of the year. It’s a time to be with loved ones, and to celebrate all that we’ve accomplished. Chinese New Year has a more than 3,000-year history and is linked to numerous myths. A well-known myth describes the supernatural beast Nian, pronounced similarly to the word “year” in Chinese, which appears on Lunar New Year’s Eve and devours humans and animals. People burned bamboo, lit candles, exhibited red paper, dressed in red, and displayed red objects to frighten the monster away. These customs have persisted up to the present day. Although regional traditions and customs differ greatly, they all revolve around saying goodbye to the previous year and wishing the new one luck and prosperity. Among the primary Chinese New Year celebrations are: decorating, making sacrifices to ancestors, having a reunion dinner with relatives on New Year’s Eve, exchanging gifts and red envelopes, setting off fireworks and firecrackers, and taking in lion and dragon dances. 1. decorating, making sacrifices to ancestorsBefore the Spring Festival, people thoroughly clean their homes to represent sweeping away the bad luck from the previous year and preparing their homes for good luck. As red is considered to be an auspicious hue for the Lunar New Year, representing prosperity and energy—which ward off evil spirits and negativity—red is the predominant color during the event. Streets are lined with red lanterns, and doorways are covered in crimson couplets and images of the New Year. A Chinese New Year custom that is adhered to is honoring the deceased. In order to demonstrate that they are letting their ancestors “eat” first, many Chinese people visit their ancestors’ graves the day before Chinese New Year’s Day, offer sacrifices to the dead before the family reunion supper, and set out an extra glass at the dinner table on New Year’s Eve. 2.having a reunion dinner with relatives on New Year’s EveFamilies typically get together during Chinese New Year (also known as the Lunar New Year). The most significant period is on Chinese New Year’s Eve. People are supposed to be at home to celebrate the event with their families, wherever they may be. The supper on Chinese New Year’s Eve is referred to as the “reunion feast.” Large families with multiple generations eat together at round tables and enjoy their time together. 3. exchanging gifts and red envelopesRed envelopes, or red packets (lsh or lai see in Cantonese), are a common sight during the Chinese New Year. Children and senior citizens in retirement are frequently given red envelopes with money inside. The term “ya sui qian” (&#x2F;yaa sway chyen&#x2F;), which translates to “suppressing Sui [the demon]money,” is used to refer to the crimson envelope (money). A safe and tranquil new year is wished to anybody who receives a red envelope. Alcohol, tea, fruits, and candies are some additional common gifts during the Lunar New Year. 4. setting off fireworks and firecrackersLighting off firecrackers and fireworks is a necessary holiday activity, from large-scale public displays in major cities to millions of home celebrations in rural China. It serves as a means of warding off evil and bringing in the new year. The largest display of fireworks at any time of year takes place in China at midnight and during the first few minutes of Chinese New Year. 5. lion and dragon dancesDuring the Lunar New Year, lion dances and dragon dances are frequently performed throughout China and Chinatowns in many Western nations. They are carried out to bring wealth and luck for the forthcoming year or occasion. Additional Chinese New Year traditions and customs include donning new attire, observing the Spring Festival Gala, and staying up late on Chinese New Year’s Eve.","categories":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"Culture","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/"},{"name":"Chinese New Year","slug":"Culture/Chinese-New-Year","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-New-Year/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Top 3 Kung Fu Styles","slug":"top3-kung-fu-styles","date":"2022-10-27T02:25:45.296Z","updated":"2022-10-27T02:45:45.224Z","comments":true,"path":"Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu/top3-kung-fu-styles/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu/top3-kung-fu-styles/","excerpt":"","text":"Chinese kung fu encompasses a vast body of knowledge and techniques. It mixes health maintenance and self-defense tactics. An athlete must often stop competing in his 30s in sports like track and field, ball sports, weightlifting, and boxing. Our capacity to exercise in later life may be impacted by injuries acquired during years of active sport activity at a young age. But there is a difference between “external” and “internal” kung fu in Chinese kung fu.According to a proverb, “In internal kung fu, you train your soul, your qi, and your mind;in external kung fu, you exercise your tendons, bones, and skin.”Therefore, internal kung fu can be practiced even as one ages and their physical strength declines. Top 3 popular chinese kung fu styles are: TaijiquanTai chi, also known as taijiquan (&#x2F;tie-jee-chwen&#x2F;), is a Taoist internal martial technique. According to one legend of taijiquan, the Taoist immortal Chang San-feng is credited with creating the form after being inspired by a battle between a ferocious eagle and a snake. Chinese Qi GongTraditional Chinese medicine’s indispensable “qi gong” (literally, “breath practice”) has its roots in antiquity. Its main source of inspiration was the Chinese people’s long-standing fascination with immortality and their quest for longevity. Shaolin Kung FuBoth in China and worldwide, Shaolin Kung Fu is well known. Shaolin shadowboxing was originally practiced for self-defense, enemy repulsion, famed mountain protection, illness treatment, old temple preservation, and mountain preservation. It features numerous patterns, straightforward forms, and extensive internal and external kung fu.","categories":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"Culture","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/"},{"name":"Chinese Kung Fu","slug":"Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Find My Chinese Zodiac Sign","slug":"find-my-chinese-zodiac-sign","date":"2022-10-23T21:29:15.911Z","updated":"2022-10-23T21:37:04.270Z","comments":true,"path":"Culture/Chinese-Zodiac/find-my-chinese-zodiac-sign/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/Culture/Chinese-Zodiac/find-my-chinese-zodiac-sign/","excerpt":"","text":"There are 12 zodiac animals that depict the Chinese zodiac, or shengxiao (&#x2F;shnng-sshyao&#x2F;, “born like”). The Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig are among them, in that order. At Chinese New Year (in January or February), Chinese zodiac years begin and end. A zodiac animal, each with its own supposed traits, represents each year in the 12-year cycle of the zodiac. The year of the tiger, 2022, begins on February 1 and lasts through January 21 of 2023. The year 2023, which begins on January 22nd and ends on February 9th, is known as the Year of the Rabbit.

Chinese New Year, the first day of the Chinese lunar calendar, occurs between January 21 and February 20. The first of the 24 Solar Terms, the Start of Spring, starts on February 3rd or 4th. For the vast majority of Chinese people, the zodiac year begins on Chinese New Year. Popular Chinese astrology is this. The first solar word is only employed by traditionalists and licensed astrologers.You might therefore be an Ox or a Rat if you were born in January or February of 1997.","categories":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"Culture","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/"},{"name":"Chinese Zodiac","slug":"Culture/Chinese-Zodiac","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-Zodiac/"}],"tags":[]}],"categories":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"Culture","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/"},{"name":"Chinese New Year","slug":"Culture/Chinese-New-Year","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-New-Year/"},{"name":"Chinese Kung Fu","slug":"Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-Kung-Fu/"},{"name":"Chinese Zodiac","slug":"Culture/Chinese-Zodiac","permalink":"https://www.discoverchinatoday.com/categories/Culture/Chinese-Zodiac/"}],"tags":[]}
