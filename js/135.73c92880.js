This is the dragon dance—one of China\'s most spectacular and enduring cultural traditions that bridges ancient spiritual beliefs with modern community celebration.\n\n## Origins in Ancient China\n\nThe dragon dance traces its roots back over 2,000 years to the Han Dynasty, where it began as a solemn ritual to honor the Dragon King and ensure favorable weather for crops.
